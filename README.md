# Conquering-Responsive-Layouts

It's all about making responsive layouts.

## Challenge 1

- Limit the total width of the .intro-conent to about half of it's parent
- Stop the text from overflowing out the bottom at small screen widths

## Solution 1

- I have set the width to 50% for the .intro-content also with percentage it will be responsive on all screens.
- In the problem since we were using height for the container that is why the content was overflowing from the bottom so I have removed it.
